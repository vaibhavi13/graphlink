# graphlink
A library that can be used to implement parallel clustering algorithms

*Takes real world graphs as inputs and generates embedding for it
*Runs k-means clustering algorithm on the generated embeddings to generate clusters
*Cluster visualization and Clustering modularity scores are calculated for partitions created by k-means
*Applications are discussed and Performance is evaluated to compare with traditional k-means algorithms
